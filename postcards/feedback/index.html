	<h1>Postcard Feedback for Lauren J.</h1>

	<h3>Aesthetic Notes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I like the abstract design, and the consistent theme between each!</li>
		<li>Interesting color choice - what's the association between purple / warm purple with Joy and/or war</li>
		<li>The thin strokes of white text can be a little hard to see on the darker background</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Structure Notes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The quote is the focus with each design, which the designs help to support</li>
		<li>In the first two, the design (not the quote) stands out a lot more</li>
		<li>For mobile layouts, the text is pretty broken up because the width of the screen is cut off a little by the design, which can interrupt reading flow</li>
	</ul> 

	<h3>Technical Notes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Seems like sizing between desktop/mobile will work, just make sure the text/design never overlap</li>
		<li>Might be good to have designs span the entire page since they'll look a little weird if cut off</li>
	</ul>
