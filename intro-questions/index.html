		<p>Hello!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>My name is Lily Wu, and I'm a senior majoring in Japanese and Biology.</li><br>

			<li>I signed up for this class because I was looking for courses in areas other than my majors that would be interesting to take! My roommate is a Communication Design major who took Interaction Foundations last fall and recommended the course to me.</li><br>

			<li>I work with HTML/CSS in Wordpress at a job in the law school and separate freelance work, but have never taken a class before. This semester I'm also taking Web Development in the Computer Science department.</li><br>

			<li>In this class, I hope to not only build a stronger foundation in HTML/CSS, but also learn key concepts in designing webpages for others to see.</li><br>

			<li>Designing for the screen is different because while changes can be made and uploaded as fast as you can type, it's different from directly drawing or painting with your hands. When making a website, you have to think a lot about who will visit the website and how best to display information while incorporating good style.</li><br>

			<li>I think the <a href="http://photorequestsfromsolitary.org/">Photo Requests from Solitary website</a> has effective design because it is easy to navigate to find the information you are looking for. The home page is captivating while displaying the requests that the project was created for. The links on the side provide additional information for people to read.</li><br>

			<li>The <a href="https://www.comicrelief.com/">Comic Relief website</a> has effective communication because it displays a call to action on the home page, letting visitors know how they may make an impact by becoming involved with the organization. The menus are easy to navigate, and the rest of the home page shows more information and how to sign up for the newsletter in order to receive more information.</li><br>

			<li><a href="https://www.tedxportland.com/">TEDxPortland's website</a> works well because it has a relatively simple and easy to navigate layout, while also having consistent and solid design. The website is coherent with the theme of TED.</li>
