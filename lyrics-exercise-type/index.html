			<p class="line"><b class="verse">[Verse 1]</b><br>
			So inconsistent with my passion that I threw it all out<br>
			I took it from you, you<br>
			So apathetic with the forces that I burned them all out<br>
			I took it from you, you</p>

			<p class="line"><b class="verse">[Pre-Chorus]</b><br>
			So when the water's rushing close<br>
			I'll find you near the edge and save you from the meso<br>
			Should've known you were gonna find out<br>
			You're gonna find out but</p>

			<p class="line"><b class="chorus">[Chorus]</b><br>
			Is it worth the episode<br>
			Is it worth the episode, oh no<br>
			Walking through the door alone<br>
			Is it worth the episode, oh no</p>

			<p class="line"><b class="verse">[Verse 2]</b><br>
			So covered up in all the fire that I never looked back<br>
			I took it from you, you<br>
			So agitated from the shadows, can I take it all back, baby<br>
			I took it from you, you</p>

			<p class="line"><b class="verse">[Pre-Chorus]</b><br>
			Oh, all your pretty mind wants<br>
			Is atoms for my bones and ashes for my thoughts<br>
			Oh, should've known you were gonna find out<br>
			I knew you'd find out but</p>

			<p class="line"><b class="chorus">[Chorus]</b><br>
			Is it worth the episode<br>
			Is it worth the episode, oh no<br>
			Walking through the door alone<br>
			Is it worth the episode, oh no</p>

			<p class="line">Should've known you were gonna find out<br>
			I knew you'd find out but</p>

			<p class="line"><b class="chorus">[Chorus]</b><br>
			Is it worth the episode<br>
			Is it worth the episode, oh no<br>
			Walking through the door alone<br>
			Is it worth the episode, oh no</p>

			<p class="line">Oh<br>
			Oh, oh no<br>
			Oh<br>
			Oh, oh yeah</p>

			<p class="line">Is it worth the episode<br>
			Is it worth the episode, oh no<br>
			Walking through the door alone<br>
			Is it worth the episode, oh no</p>

			<p class="line"><b class="verse">[Outro]</b><br>
			Should've known you were gonna find out<br>
			(Should've known you were gonna find out)<br>
			Should've known you were gonna find out<br>
			(I knew you'd find out)</p>
